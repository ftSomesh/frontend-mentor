## My process

### Built with

* **Semantic HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox** for layout
* **Desktop-first** workflow
* **Responsive design** with media queries
* **Gradient backgrounds** and subtle shadows for a clean modern look

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **responsive design** and **visual composition** using gradients and Flexbox.
I also practiced creating a **mock mobile chat interface** purely with HTML and CSS, focusing on hierarchy, spacing, and subtle details.

Some specific learnings include:

```css
/* Using linear-gradient for smooth background transitions */
.gradient-bg {
      --linear-background: linear-gradient(to left, hsl(293, 100%, 63%), hsl(264, 100%, 61%));
}


```

And a neat HTML snippet I’m proud of:

```html
 <div class="three-button-navigation">
  <span class="circle-nav"></span>
  <span class="circle-nav"></span>
  <span class="circle-nav"></span>
  </div>
```

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

* Add **simple animations** to the chat messages on load
* Experiment more with **CSS clip-path** and **shapes** for creative backgrounds
* Focus more on **accessibility** and better **HTML structure** for screen readers
